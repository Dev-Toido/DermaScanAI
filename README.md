## 🧠 System Architecture

Unlike standard image-classification pipelines, DermaScan AI mimics clinical workflows by interpreting both visual and biological markers simultaneously. 

### Multi-Modal Fusion Engine
1. **Visual Stream (Image Processing):** Extracts spatial features, border irregularity, and color variegation from dermoscopic imagery (`224x224` resolution).
2. **Tabular Stream (Biological Metadata):** Processes one-hot encoded anatomical site locations, binary sex variables, and normalized patient age.
3. **Concatenation Layer:** Both data streams are mathematically fused within a dense neural network to adjust baseline visual predictions against biological risk factors.

### Tech Stack
* **Deep Learning Framework:** TensorFlow / Keras
* **Data Manipulation:** Pandas, NumPy
* **Frontend Web App:** Streamlit (with custom clinical CSS injection)
* **Dataset:** ISIC (International Skin Imaging Collaboration) Archive
